PyAssistant: daily, simple python challenges to refresh your coding knowledge. 

Admit it, you aren't as good at coding as you think you are. No shame in that. However, staying bad will only decrease your chances at success. I'd hate that for you. So get practicing already before it's too late.

Challenges refreshed every day with medium difficulty. Chatbot (GPT-4) ready to assist you, but no giveaways!
